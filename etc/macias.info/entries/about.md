# About this blog

This blog born as a learning experiment with [Go language](http://www.golang.org) but it is intended
to be used as a serious blog, evolving the source code as long as new necessities arise.

The [source code](http://github.com/mariomac/goblog) of this blog is available on Github and follows
a really [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) philosophy.
